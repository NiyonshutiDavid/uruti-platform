I'm a first-time founder with a SaaS idea for small businesses. I've built a prototype but haven't gotten any paying customers yet.

Focus on customer discovery first - reach out to 50+ small business owners to validate your problem hypothesis. Don't just ask if they like your solution; ask about their current workflows and pain points. Once you understand their needs better, refine your prototype to address the most critical issues.

"Our startup launched 18 months ago but we're struggling with high churn rates (15% monthly), low conversion from trial to paid (2%), and our CAC is higher than our LTV. What should we do?",,"Your startup falls into the 'Needs Refinement' category and requires immediate attention to unit economics. Here's a systematic approach: 1) Churn Analysis: Interview churned customers to identify patterns - is it product fit, onboarding, or value realization? 2) Conversion Optimization: Analyze your trial-to-paid funnel, improve onboarding experience, and add more value during trial period. 3) Cost Reduction: Pause expensive acquisition channels, focus on organic growth and referrals. 4) Product-Market Fit: You may need to pivot your target market or core features. 5) Consider a strategic pause on growth to fix fundamentals. These metrics suggest fundamental issues that need addressing before scaling further.",needs_refinement,"### Instruction: Our startup launched 18 months ago but we're struggling with high churn rates (15% monthly), low conversion from trial to paid (2%), and our CAC is higher than our LTV.
